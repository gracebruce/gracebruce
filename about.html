<h1>HISTORY OF THE COMPANY</h1>
<p>Grace is synonymous to comfort for Filipinos. The cafe and bakery feels like a home away from home, because it’s exactly that: the extension of the owners’ home. Hence, how they handle everything, from interiors, food choices, employee orientation, to customer service, is measured against a higher standard of care. This is the principle that has been guiding the establishment for 27 years now. Mary Grace is synonymous to comfort for Filipinos. The cafe and bakery feels like a home away from home, because it’s exactly that: the extension of the owners’ home. Hence, how they handle everything, from interiors, food choices, employee orientation, to customer service, is measured against a higher standard of care. This is the principle that has been guiding the establishment for 27 years now.Marketing Director Chiara Dimacali-Hugo likens the Mary Grace story to that of a book with colorful chapters. Her fondness is palpable as she recounts the origins of the now 45-café and 47-kiosk chain. Together with Operations VP Marian Dimacali Calaquian, not only do they have a unique, personal view of the store’s beginnings, they also share a special privilege in shaping the brand’s future. 
What sets them apart as narrators is aside from pride, awe and gratitude equally emanate in their tone. Not only do they get to live out the page-turner, they also get a hand in writing it. Preparing The Right Ingredients: The Formative Years
The siblings’ involvement began long before they officially joined. They reminisce with Preview about Christmas breaks that were spent assembling boxes for their famed ensaymadas, and weekends spent manning bazaars with their three brothers (who are also currently onboard the venture). These formative experiences have molded them to the executives they are now. However, it’s also something that takes maturity to fully appreciate, according to Chiara. </p>
